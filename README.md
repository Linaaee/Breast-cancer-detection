# Description
The goal of the code above is to give as a result images that are similar. The program processes a database composed of breast cancer images then it calculates the histograms of the images as well as the distance between these histograms to finally display the images that have a distance close to the query image. Finally, to evaluate the performance of this program, I calculated the recall and precision.
# Database
The database contains 212 images of 4 breast densities, the first 142 images are classified as malignant and the last 70 images are classified as benign.
The database can be found in my drive folder: <br>
