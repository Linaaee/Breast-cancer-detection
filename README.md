# Description
The goal of the code above is to detect breast cancer. The program processes a database composed of breast cancer images then it calculates the histograms of the images as well as the distance between these histograms to finally display the images that have a distance close to the query image. Finally, to evaluate the performance of this program, I calculated the recall and precision.
